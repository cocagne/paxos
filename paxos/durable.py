'''
This module implements a very simple mechanism for crash-proof storage
of an object's internal state.

The DurableObjectHandler class is given an object to durably persist along with
an object_id that is used to distinguish between multiple durable objects
persisted to the same directory. Whenever a savepoint is reached in the
application, the handler's save() method may be used to store the objects state
to disk. The application or machine is permitted to fail at any point. If
the failure occurs mid-write, the corruption will be detected by the
DurableObjectHandler constructor and the previously stored state will be
loaded.

This implementation does not reliably protect against on-disk corruption.  That
is to say, if the most-recently saved file is modified after it is successfully
written to the disk, such as through hardware or software errors, the saved
state will be permanently lost. As this implementation provides now way to
distinguish between files that failed to write and files that were
corrupted-on-disk, the implementation will assume the initial write failed and
will return the previously saved state (assuming it isn't similarly
corrupted). Consequently, there is a small but real chance that an application
may save its state with this implementation, make promises to external
entities, crash, and reneg on those promises after recovery. The likelyhood is,
of course, very very low so this implementation should be suitable for most
"good" reliability systems. Just don't implement a life-support system based on
this code...

Design Approach:

* Toggle writes between two different files
* Include a monotonically incrementing serial number in each write to
  allow determination of the most recent version
* md5sum the entire content of the data to be written and prefix the write
  with the digest
* fsync() after each write
